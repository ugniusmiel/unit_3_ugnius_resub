My digital portfolio is mainly made for an IT employer as it talks about me and my skills/interests and my cording/collage work.

I have tested on two different websites and nothing breaks the only thing that changes is the loading speed of the images and video.

I have tested zooming in and out and making the screen bigger and smaller making it bigger makes some of the nav bars move up a bit and the text become smaller. making it smaller makes the texts become bigger but if you zoom in to much it breaks the nav bars.



I have included a lot of things about me like attributes, achievements, hobbys and work related things as the digital portfolio is aimed at employers so i added in as many things about me so the employer would know more about me.
